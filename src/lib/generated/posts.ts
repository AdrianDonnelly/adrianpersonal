Just a week ago, I was uncertain about my next steps. Now, everything is moving quickly. I look forward to starting this new chapter.\n\nThanks to Estelle Charveriat, Maxence Jamet, and the Entrepreneurs First team for this opportunity to advance my work.\n\n### Building AI Agents Like Lego Blocks\n\n![Visual of the block-based AI system](/images/17282111075917284322.webp)\n\nMy entry to The Bridge came through a project I developed at the Entrepreneurs First European Builders League (EBL) hackathon in Milan. The directive was straightforward: build something meaningful.\n\nI created a block-based, drag-and-drop system for building AI agents - similar to Scratch, but for AI workflows. The system allows you to create functional AI pipelines by connecting blocks representing:\n\n- 🗣️ Voice input processing (AI calls)\n- 💬 WhatsApp, SMS, and text handling\n- 🎙️ Text-to-speech generation for audio output\n- ⚡ Webhook triggers for external integrations\n\nThe system's strength lies in its flexibility - it enables the creation of various AI applications without requiring coding skills.\n\nThe Milan event was memorable. Thanks to Entrepreneurs First, Maxence Jamet, Estelle Charveriat, Antoine Duchein, and all participants who made it worthwhile.\n\nThe image shows the system's interface where blocks connect to form AI agent workflows through visual programming.\n\n### What's Next\n\nThe Bridge provides the framework I need to develop my work further. This residency offers dedicated time and resources to build something substantial. I'm looking forward to collaborating with fellow engineers on challenging projects.\n\nThe Bridge creates an environment where ambitious ideas can develop into practical solutions. After the program, participants will travel to San Francisco - an ideal location to present our work and explore further opportunities.\n\nI appreciate this chance to work alongside other engineers and expand the scope of my projects.\n\nIf you're interested in joining The Bridge yourself, check out [their website](https://www.join-thebridge.com/) for more information and application details.","id":"_New_Chapter_The_Bridge"};

Whether you’re into AI,\nspeech synthesis, or just exploring new tech, setting up **GPT-SoVITS** can be tricky, especially when it comes to configuring **ROCm**. This guide will make the process\neasier, whether you choose to enable **ROCm** or not.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore getting started, make sure you have a Linux machine with an AMD GPU (for ROCm support), or if you are just setting it up without ROCm, a standard setup will do. We'll also need Python 3.9 installed to ensure compatibility.\n\n### Warnings\n\n1. **ROCm Support**: If you’re planning to use **ROCm** with **PyTorch**, make sure you have an AMD GPU that supports it. Not all AMD GPUs are compatible with **ROCm**.\n2. **Linux Only**: This guide is for Linux machines only. If you’re using Windows or macOS, you might need to adapt the steps accordingly.\n3. **Commands**: These commands are for **Ubuntu** and **Debian**-based distributions. If you’re using a different distribution, you might need to adjust the commands.\n\n\n### Step 1: Install Python 3.9 & Additional Libraries\n\nYou’ll need to install Python 3.9 and some additional libraries to get started with GPT-SoVITS, python 3.9.x is required for compatibility with some of the pip packages.\n\n1. Add the repository for Python 3.9:\n```bash\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa\nsudo apt update\n```\n\n2. Install Python 3.9:\n```bash\nsudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends python3.9 python3.9-dev python3.9-venv\n```\n\n3. Install additional libraries:\n```bash\nsudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends tzdata ffmpeg libsox-dev parallel aria2 git git-lfs\n```\n\n\n### Step 2: Clone the GPT-SoVITS Repository\n\nNow let’s clone the GPT-SoVITS repository to your local machine.\n\n1. Create a folder for your workspace (choose any location):\n```bash\ncd ~/Documents\n```\n\n2. Clone the GPT-SoVITS repository:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS\ncd ./GPT-SoVITS # Move to the repository directory\n```\n\n### Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment\n\nThough it’s not everyone's favorite step, I highly recommend using a **virtual environment**. It keeps dependencies isolated and makes your life easier.\n\n1. Create a virtual environment:\n```bash\npython3.9 -m venv gptSovitsVenv\n```\n\n2. Activate the virtual environment:\n```bash\nsource gptSovitsVenv/bin/activate\n```\n\n3. Deactivate when you’re done (if needed):\n```bash\ndeactivate\n```\n\n### Step 4: Optional: Install ROCm Support (For AMD GPUs)\n\nIf you have an AMD GPU and want to use ROCm for improved performance, you’ll need to install PyTorch with ROCm support.\n\n1. Uninstall the default `torch`, `torchaudio`, and `torchvision`:\n```bash\npip uninstall torch torchaudio torchvision\n```\n\n2. Install PyTorch with ROCm support:\n> **Note**: As of writing this guide, the latest version of ROCm is 6.3. Make sure to replace `rocm6.3` with the correct version if it has been updated.\n```bash\npip install --pre torch pytorch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm6.3/\npip install --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager optimum[amd]\n```\n\n### Step 5: Install Dependencies\n\nInstall the necessary dependencies for GPT-SoVITS, please note that if you failed to install the additional libraries in step 1, you might encounter errors during this step.\n\n1. Upgrade `pip`:\n```bash\npip install --upgrade pip\n```\n\n2. Install essential packages:\n```bash\npip install --upgrade setuptools\n```\n\n3. Install the requirements:\n```bash\npip install -r ./requirements.txt\n```\n\n\n\n### Step 6: Test Your PyTorch Installation (Optional)\n\n> **Note**: If you are using **ROCm**, you should still see `CUDA available!` if everything is set up correctly.\n\nMake sure that PyTorch is properly installed and can detect your GPU (if applicable).\n\n1. Run the following Python command to test CUDA availability:\n```bash\npython -c \"import torch; print('CUDA available!' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'CUDA not available!')\"\n```\n\nIf you’re using an AMD GPU with ROCm / Nvidia GPU, it will print `CUDA available!` (you may see `CUDA not available!` if using a different setup).\n\n\n[//]: # (### Step 7: Install TensorFlow)\n\n[//]: # ()\n[//]: # (If you plan to use TensorFlow for any other tasks, it’s helpful to install it in your environment.)\n\n[//]: # ()\n[//]: # (1. Install TensorFlow with ROCm support:)\n\n[//]: # (```bash)\n\n[//]: # (pip install --pre tensorflow-rocm==2.17.0 -f https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/manylinux/rocm-rel-6.3/ --force-reinstall)\n\n[//]: # (```)\n\n\n\n### Step 8: Set Up Pretrained Models\n\nNow let’s set up the pretrained models needed for GPT-SoVITS.\n\n**Important**: You need to be in the **root directory** of the cloned repository to run these commands.\n\n1. Create directories for the pretrained models:\n```bash\nmkdir -p ./GPT_SoVITS/pretrained_models\nmkdir -p ./tools/damo_asr/models\nmkdir -p ./tools/uvr5\n```\n\n2. Clone the necessary models:\n```bash\ngit clone https://huggingface.co/lj1995/GPT-SoVITS ./GPT_SoVITS/pretrained_models\ngit clone https://www.modelscope.cn/damo/speech_paraformer-large_asr_nat-zh-cn-16k-common-vocab8404-pytorch.git ./tools/damo_asr/models\ngit clone https://www.modelscope.cn/damo/speech_fsmn_vad_zh-cn-16k-common-pytorch.git ./tools/damo_asr/models\ngit clone https://www.modelscope.cn/damo/punc_ct-transformer_zh-cn-common-vocab272727-pytorch.git ./tools/damo_asr/models\ngit clone https://huggingface.co/Delik/uvr5_weights ./tools/uvr5\n```\n\n3. Move the model weights to the appropriate directory:\n```bash\nmv ./GPT_SoVITS/pretrained_models/GPT-SoVITS/* ./GPT_SoVITS/pretrained_models/\n```\n\n\n\n### Step 9: Download Additional Weights\n\nSome additional weights might be needed, like the **Nagisa** model. Download it from HuggingFace:\n\n1. Download **Nagisa.zip** from [this link](https://huggingface.co/modelloosrvcc/Nagisa_Shingetsu_GPT-SoVITS/resolve/main/Nagisa.zip).\n2. Extract the `.pth` files to the `./GPT-SoVITS/SoVITS_weights/` directory.\n3. Move `.ckpt` files to the `./GPT-SoVITS/GPT_weights/` directory.\n\n\n\n\n### Step 10: Run Inference\n\nFinally, run the inference script / fine tune the model:\n\n#### Inference\n\n- ROCm: `PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH=gfx1101 python ./GPT_SoVITS/inference_webui.py`\n- Standard: `python ./GPT_SoVITS/inference_webui.py`\n\n#### Fine-tuning\n\n- ROCm: `PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH=gfx1101 python ./webui.py`\n- Standard: `python ./webui.py`\n\n\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n- If you encounter errors like `NameError: name 'Tuple' is not defined`, open the file `patched_mha_with_cache.py` and add the following import:\n```python\nfrom typing import Tuple\n```\n\n- If you encounter errors that mention `nltk`, you might need to install the `nltk` package:\n```bash\npip install nltk\n```\n\nAfter installing `nltk`, you might also need to download the `averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng` model:\n```bash\npython -c \"import nltk; nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng')\"\n```\n\n\n[//]: # (### Generating Speech with GPT-SoVITS!)\n\n[//]: # ()\n[//]: # (Run the inference script and start generating speech with GPT-SoVITS. )\n\n[//]: # ()\n[//]: # (It should open a web interface where you can input text and generate speech. You can also fine-tune the model to improve the quality of the generated speech.)\n\n[//]: # ()\n\n\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAnd there you go! You’ve successfully installed GPT-SoVITS with (or without) ROCm support. Enjoy generating lifelike speech with GPT-SoVITS and explore its full potential.","id":"_GPT_SoVITS_ROCM"};

Streamline customer service without over-relying on LLMs, which are often hit-or-miss when it comes\nto structured tasks. Instead, Serros.ML takes a controlled, repeatable approach. Think less \"AI magic,\" more \n\"AI that works when you need it.\"\n\n### Why Serros.ML?\n\nWe’re not here to follow the AI trend for the sake of it. We see AI as a practical tool, a way to simplify \nprocesses and create real value, not add unnecessary complexity.\n\nHere’s where we stand:\n- **Not just a chatbot:** Serros.ML isn’t about replicating human agents; it’s about empowering them.\n- **No spammy automation:** We focus on task-driven workflows, not blasting customers with unsolicited spam.\n- **Control over chaos:** Unlike others, we aim for structured, reliable outputs you can trust.\n- **Purpose-built AI:** It’s not AI for AI’s sake. It’s AI built to solve real problems businesses face every day.\n\n### Landing Page: Coming Soon!\n\n![Landing Page](/images/6970284456761404686.webp)\n\n> Serros.ML Landing Page Preview\n\nWe’re working hard to roll out our site, and we’re almost there.

A Markdown-formatted\ndocument should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking\nlike it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While\nMarkdown's syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML\nfilters -- including [Setext](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/mirror/setext.html), [atx](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/atx/), [Textile](http://textism.com/tools/textile/), [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html),\n[Grutatext](http://www.triptico.com/software/grutatxt.html), and [EtText](http://ettext.taint.org/doc/) -- the single biggest source of\ninspiration for Markdown's syntax is the format of plain text email.\n\n## Block Elements\n\n### Paragraphs and Line Breaks\n\nA paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated\nby one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a\nblank line -- a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered\nblank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.\n\nThe implication of the \"one or more consecutive lines of text\" rule is\nthat Markdown supports \"hard-wrapped\" text paragraphs. This differs\nsignificantly from most other text-to-HTML formatters (including Movable\nType's \"Convert Line Breaks\" option) which translate every line break\ncharacter in a paragraph into a `<br />` tag.\n\nWhen you *do* want to insert a `<br />` break tag using Markdown, you\nend a line with two or more spaces, then type return.\n\n### Headers\n\nMarkdown supports two styles of headers, [Setext] [1] and [atx] [2].\n\nOptionally, you may \"close\" atx-style headers. This is purely\ncosmetic -- you can use this if you think it looks better. The\nclosing hashes don't even need to match the number of hashes\nused to open the header. (The number of opening hashes\ndetermines the header level.)\n\n\n### Blockquotes\n\nMarkdown uses email-style `>` characters for blockquoting. If you're\nfamiliar with quoting passages of text in an email message, then you\nknow how to create a blockquote in Markdown. It looks best if you hard\nwrap the text and put a `>` before every line:\n\n> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n> consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.\n> Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.\n>\n> Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse\n> id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\n\nMarkdown allows you to be lazy and only put the `>` before the first\nline of a hard-wrapped paragraph:\n\n> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\nconsectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.\nVestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.\n\n> Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse\nid sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\n\nBlockquotes can be nested (i.e. a blockquote-in-a-blockquote) by\nadding additional levels of `>`:\n\n> This is the first level of quoting.\n>\n> > This is nested blockquote.\n>\n> Back to the first level.\n\nBlockquotes can contain other Markdown elements, including headers, lists,\nand code blocks:\n\n> ## This is a header.\n>\n> 1.   This is the first list item.\n> 2.   This is the second list item.\n>\n> Here's some example code:\n>\n>     return shell_exec(\"echo $input | $markdown_script\");\n\nAny decent text editor should make email-style quoting easy. For\nexample, with BBEdit, you can make a selection and choose Increase\nQuote Level from the Text menu.\n\n\n### Lists\n\nMarkdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.\n\nUnordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens -- interchangably\n-- as list markers:\n\n*   Red\n*   Green\n*   Blue\n\nis equivalent to:\n\n+   Red\n+   Green\n+   Blue\n\nand:\n\n-   Red\n-   Green\n-   Blue\n\nOrdered lists use numbers followed by periods:\n\n1.  Bird\n2.  McHale\n3.  Parish\n\nIt's important to note that the actual numbers you use to mark the\nlist have no effect on the HTML output Markdown produces. The HTML\nMarkdown produces from the above list is:\n\nIf you instead wrote the list in Markdown like this:\n\n1.  Bird\n1.  McHale\n1.  Parish\n\nor even:\n\n3. Bird\n1. McHale\n8. Parish\n\nyou'd get the exact same HTML output. The point is, if you want to,\nyou can use ordinal numbers in your ordered Markdown lists, so that\nthe numbers in your source match the numbers in your published HTML.\nBut if you want to be lazy, you don't have to.\n\nTo make lists look nice, you can wrap items with hanging indents:\n\n*   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.\n    Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,\n    viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.\n*   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.\n    Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\n\nBut if you want to be lazy, you don't have to:\n\n*   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.\n    Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,\n    viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.\n*   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.\n    Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\n\nList items may consist of multiple paragraphs. Each subsequent\nparagraph in a list item must be indented by either 4 spaces\nor one tab:\n\n1.  This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor\n    sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit\n    mi posuere lectus.\n\n    Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet\n    vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum\n    sit amet velit.\n\n2.  Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\n\nIt looks nice if you indent every line of the subsequent\nparagraphs, but here again, Markdown will allow you to be\nlazy:\n\n*   This is a list item with two paragraphs.\n\n    This is the second paragraph in the list item. You're\n    only required to indent the first line. Lorem ipsum dolor\n    sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.\n\n*   Another item in the same list.\n\nTo put a blockquote within a list item, the blockquote's `>`\ndelimiters need to be indented:\n\n*   A list item with a blockquote:\n\n    > This is a blockquote\n    > inside a list item.\n\nTo put a code block within a list item, the code block needs\nto be indented *twice* -- 8 spaces or two tabs:\n\n*   A list item with a code block:\n\n        <code goes here>\n\n### Code Blocks\n\nPre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or\nmarkup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines\nof a code block are interpreted literally. Markdown wraps a code block\nin both `<pre>` and `<code>` tags.\n\nTo produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the\nblock by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab.\n\nThis is a normal paragraph:\n\n    This is a code block.\n\nHere is an example of AppleScript:\n\n    tell application \"Foo\"\n        beep\n    end tell\n\nA code block continues until it reaches a line that is not indented\n(or the end of the article).\n\nWithin a code block, ampersands (`&`) and angle brackets (`<` and `>`)\nare automatically converted into HTML entities. This makes it very\neasy to include example HTML source code using Markdown -- just paste\nit and indent it, and Markdown will handle the hassle of encoding the\nampersands and angle brackets. For example, this:\n\n    <div class=\"footer\">\n        &copy; 2004 Foo Corporation\n    </div>\n\nRegular Markdown syntax is not processed within code blocks. E.g.,\nasterisks are just literal asterisks within a code block. This means\nit's also easy to use Markdown to write about Markdown's own syntax.\n\n```\ntell application \"Foo\"\n    beep\nend tell\n```\n\n## Span Elements\n\n### Links\n\nMarkdown supports two style of links: *inline* and *reference*.\n\nIn both styles, the link text is delimited by [square brackets].\n\nTo create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately\nafter the link text's closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses,\nput the URL where you want the link to point, along with an *optional*\ntitle for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:\n\nThis is [an example](http://example.com/) inline link.\n\n[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.\n\n### Emphasis\n\nMarkdown treats asterisks (`*`) and underscores (`_`) as indicators of\nemphasis. Text wrapped with one `*` or `_` will be wrapped with an\nHTML `<em>` tag; double `*`'s or `_`'s will be wrapped with an HTML\n`<strong>` tag. E.g., this input:\n\n*single asterisks*\n\n_single underscores_\n\n**double asterisks**\n\n__double underscores__\n\n### Code\n\nTo indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (`` ` ``).\nUnlike a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within a\nnormal paragraph. For example:\n\nUse the `printf()` function.","id":"_Markdown_Test"};

It's been an incredible learning experience.\n\n### Our Project\n\nOur project focused on simplifying the management of chronic conditions through an AI phone service. \nWe designed this innovative tool to eliminate the need for apps or smartphones, making it more\naccessible and user-friendly for patients. Our goal was to make healthcare more efficient \nand patient-centric.\n\nI was the team lead for this project, and I was focused on ensuring that our solution was\ntechnologically sound and user-friendly. I personally worked on the AI System and Clinician\nBackend, we used a combination of Python, Typescript, Cloudflare and Bland AI to create this\nsolution, you can check out the conversation flow in the image below:\n\n![AI Conversation Flow](/images/8516382344345283282.webp)\n\n> Bland AI Conversation Flow\n\n### The Hackathon Experience\n\nThe hackathon was a jam packed **24** hours, with **78 students** from TU Dublin dividing into 20+ teams to \ntackle five challenges set by Tallaght University Hospital. We were honored to have Senior Cloud \nSolutions Architects from AWS provide expertise and guidance throughout the process, although, we did \nnot use AWS services in our solution, we did ask for advice on how we could implement it in the future.\n\nWe worked closely with clinicians to gain a deeper understanding of the brief and ensure our\nsolution met the needs of both patients and healthcare professionals. The support we received \nfrom TUH and AWS was invaluable, and their presentations on ethics, data, cyber security, and GDPR \nwere crucial in developing a technological solution that prioritized patient well-being.\n\n### The Outcome\n\nWe're thrilled to have won the \"_Best Patient Benefit_\" award for our project. It's an incredible\nfeeling knowing that our work has the potential to make a real difference in people's lives.\n\n### What's Next?\n\nWe are currently exploring opportunities to further develop our project and potentially bring it to market,\nwe have reached out to the startup incubator at TU Dublin.","id":"_2024_TUH_Healthcare_Hackathon"};
