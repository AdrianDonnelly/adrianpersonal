# The Intern Hackathon has officially Concluded at Mastercard Dublin!
What an incredible week! We just wrapped up the Mastercard Intern Hackathon, an intense but rewarding experience where our team created the app: WellnessHub.

## WellnessHub: Employee Wellness
We built WellnessHub as a comprehensive app and website designed to empower employees to make healthy choices easier. It's all about putting well-being at their fingertips.

### Key features include:
Personalized AI Chatbot: This intelligent assistant provides tailored recommendations for diet, fitness routines, and much more, adapting to individual needs and preferences.

Fitness Tracker: Seamlessly integrated with the Sports and Social Committee, this feature offers employees better access to events, challenges, and opportunities to stay active within Mastercard.

Diet Planner: To simplify healthy eating, our diet planner is directly integrated with the Office Cafe Menu, making it easy for employees to make informed and healthy choices for their meals on-site.

## The Hackathon: Collaboration and Creation
The week was a blur of brainstorming, coding, and learning. Our team poured our energy into bringing WellnessHub to life, supported every step of the way by our dedicated mentors from Mastercard. Their guidance was invaluable in transforming our ideas into a tangible product.
'm incredibly proud of our team's achievement! The Mastercard Intern Hackathon was an invaluable experience, providing us with hands-on development skills, fostering teamwork, and offering a unique insight into innovation within a leading global company. I'm excited for what's next and to apply these learnings in future endeavors.
