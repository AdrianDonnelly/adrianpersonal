### My Team's Winning Project at the TU Dublin Hackathon


I'm excited to share that my team won the "_Best Patient Benefit_" award at the TU Dublin Digital Health
Innovation Challenge.
My team, consisting of Grzegorz Maniak, David Byrne, Thomas Lynch, 
and _myself_, Adrian Donnelly, worked tirelessly overnight to develop a solution that would benefit patients 
struggling with chronic illnesses.
### Our Project

Our project focused on simplifying the management of chronic conditions through an AI phone service. 
We designed this innovative tool to eliminate the need for apps or smartphones, making it more
accessible and user-friendly for patients. Our goal was to make healthcare more efficient 
and patient-centric. We used a combination of Python, Typescript, Cloudflare and Bland AI to create this
solution, you can check out the conversation flow in the image below:

### The Hackathon Experience

The hackathon was a jam packed **24** hours, with **78 students** from TU Dublin dividing into 20+ teams to 
tackle five challenges set by Tallaght University Hospital. We were honored to have Senior Cloud 
Solutions Architects from AWS provide expertise and guidance throughout the process, although, we did 
not use AWS services in our solution, we did ask for advice on how we could implement it in the future.

We worked closely with clinicians to gain a deeper understanding of the brief and ensure our
solution met the needs of both patients and healthcare professionals. The support we received 
from TUH and AWS was invaluable, and their presentations on ethics, data, cyber security, and GDPR 
were crucial in developing a technological solution that prioritized patient well-being.

### The Outcome

We're thrilled to have won the "_Best Patient Benefit_" award for our project. It's an incredible
feeling knowing that our work has the potential to make a real difference in people's lives.

### What's Next?

We are currently exploring opportunities to further develop our project and potentially bring it to market,
we have reached out to the startup incubator at TU Dublin.
