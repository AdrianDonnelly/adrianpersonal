# Introducing Serros.ML

Greg and I are excited to share **Serros.ML**, a programmable, event-driven AI customer support assistant. 
We’re building something more than just another chatbot, it’s a smarter way to manage customer interactions, 
blending AI and workflows to get things done efficiently and predictably.

Our idea? Streamline customer service without over-relying on LLMs, which are often hit-or-miss when it comes
to structured tasks. Instead, Serros.ML takes a controlled, repeatable approach. Think less "AI magic," more 
"AI that works when you need it."

### Why Serros.ML?

We’re not here to follow the AI trend for the sake of it. We see AI as a practical tool, a way to simplify 
processes and create real value, not add unnecessary complexity.

Here’s where we stand:
- **Not just a chatbot:** Serros.ML isn’t about replicating human agents; it’s about empowering them.
- **No spammy automation:** We focus on task-driven workflows, not blasting customers with unsolicited spam.
- **Control over chaos:** Unlike others, we aim for structured, reliable outputs you can trust.
- **Purpose-built AI:** It’s not AI for AI’s sake. It’s AI built to solve real problems businesses face every day.

### Landing Page: Coming Soon!

We’re working hard to roll out our site, and we’re almost there. Our landing page will give you a quick look at what we’re building, where we’re going, and how we aim to improve customer service. Expect an easy-to-navigate experience that lets you explore Serros.ML in a few clicks.

### How Users Will Interact: A Scratch-like System

One of the things we’re excited about is the **interactive interface** we’re designing for users. It’s built around a drag-and-drop system where you can create your own workflows by placing "blocks" into the conversation flow. Want to extract a variable from the conversation? Drag the **Extract Variable Block**. Need a condition? Use the **If** or **If-Else** blocks. When it’s time to end the conversation, simply drag the **End Call** block. It’s that simple.

### What’s Next?

We’ve made solid progress on our MVP, and we’re excited about what’s ahead. From planning customer conversation workflows to designing a dashboard that puts users in control, things are moving fast.
