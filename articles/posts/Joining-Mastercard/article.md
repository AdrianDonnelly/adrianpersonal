## Joining Mastercard as a Software Engineering Intern

I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be joining Mastercard as a Software Engineering Intern starting in February 2025!
I will be based in the Dublin tech hub, and I will be working there for 6 months as part of my university program.
I'm incredibly excited for the opportunity to learn from some of the best in the industry and gain hands-on experience at a company with such an innovative and impactful legacy.

## Looking Forward
I’m excited about the challenges, growth opportunities, and the chance to apply my skills in a real-world setting. Whether it’s through technical projects, social events, or just daily interactions with colleagues, I know this experience will be an incredible stepping stone in my career as a software engineer.
