We just wrapped up the Mastercard Intern Hackathon, an intense but rewarding experience where our team created the app: WellnessHub.\n\n## WellnessHub: Employee Wellness\nWe built WellnessHub as a comprehensive app and website designed to empower employees to make healthy choices easier. It's all about putting well-being at their fingertips.\n\n### Key features include:\nPersonalized AI Chatbot: This intelligent assistant provides tailored recommendations for diet, fitness routines, and much more, adapting to individual needs and preferences.\n\nFitness Tracker: Seamlessly integrated with the Sports and Social Committee, this feature offers employees better access to events, challenges, and opportunities to stay active within Mastercard.\n\nDiet Planner: To simplify healthy eating, our diet planner is directly integrated with the Office Cafe Menu, making it easy for employees to make informed and healthy choices for their meals on-site.\n\n## The Hackathon: Collaboration and Creation\nThe week was a blur of brainstorming, coding, and learning. Our team poured our energy into bringing WellnessHub to life, supported every step of the way by our dedicated mentors from Mastercard. Their guidance was invaluable in transforming our ideas into a tangible product.\n'm incredibly proud of our team's achievement! The Mastercard Intern Hackathon was an invaluable experience, providing us with hands-on development skills, fostering teamwork, and offering a unique insight into innovation within a leading global company.

Streamline customer service without over-relying on LLMs, which are often hit-or-miss when it comes\nto structured tasks. Instead, Serros.ML takes a controlled, repeatable approach. Think less \"AI magic,\" more \n\"AI that works when you need it.\"\n\n### Why Serros.ML?\n\nWe’re not here to follow the AI trend for the sake of it. We see AI as a practical tool, a way to simplify \nprocesses and create real value, not add unnecessary complexity.\n\nHere’s where we stand:\n- **Not just a chatbot:** Serros.ML isn’t about replicating human agents; it’s about empowering them.\n- **No spammy automation:** We focus on task-driven workflows, not blasting customers with unsolicited spam.\n- **Control over chaos:** Unlike others, we aim for structured, reliable outputs you can trust.\n- **Purpose-built AI:** It’s not AI for AI’s sake. It’s AI built to solve real problems businesses face every day.\n\n### Landing Page: Coming Soon!\n\n![Landing Page](/images/6970284456761404686.webp)\n\n> Serros.ML Landing Page Preview\n\nWe’re working hard to roll out our site, and we’re almost there. Our landing page will give you a quick look at what we’re building, where we’re going, and how we aim to improve customer service. Expect an easy-to-navigate experience that lets you explore Serros.ML in a few clicks.\n\n### How Users Will Interact: A Scratch-like System\n\n![Scratch System](/images/394341071847294269.webp)\n\n> Serros.ML Scratch-like System Preview\n\nOne of the things we’re excited about is the **interactive interface** we’re designing for users. It’s built around a drag-and-drop system where you can create your own workflows by placing \"blocks\" into the conversation flow. Want to extract a variable from the conversation? Drag the **Extract Variable Block**. Need a condition? Use the **If** or **If-Else** blocks. When it’s time to end the conversation, simply drag the **End Call** block. It’s that simple.\n\n### What’s Next?\n\nWe’ve made solid progress on our MVP, and we’re excited about what’s ahead. From planning customer conversation workflows to designing a dashboard that puts users in control, things are moving fast.\n\nIf you’re interested in joining us on this journey, whether you’re curious, want to invest, or just like what we’re building, shoot us a message at [hey@serros.ml](mailto:hey@serros.ml)\nor follow us on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/company/serrosml/).\n\nLet’s make customer support smarter, together.\n\n\n\n\n","id":"_Serros_ML"};
